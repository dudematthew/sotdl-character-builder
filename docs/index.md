# Shadow of the Demon Lord Character Creator - Documentation

This directory contains the detailed documentation for the Shadow of the Demon Lord (SotDL) Character Creator application. These documents serve as a roadmap for implementation and provide technical guidance for developers.

## Application Structure

The application is divided into several core routes, each with its own functionality and purpose:

### 1. [Character Creation](./character-creation-plan.md)
- Character creation workflow
- Selecting ancestry and paths
- Attribute calculations and modifications
- Character leveling
- Character naming and description

### 2. [Paths and Ancestries Manager](./content-manager-plan.md)
- Listing available ancestries and paths
- Adding new custom content
- Modifying existing content
- Removing content
- [Function Factory Pattern](./function-factory-plan.md) for creating complex game mechanics

### 3. [Character History](./character-history-plan.md)
- Saving character creation history
- Viewing previously created characters
- Loading characters from history
- Editing historical characters
- Removing characters from history

### 4. [Import/Export System](./import-export-plan.md)
